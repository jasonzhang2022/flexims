//strange FetchGroup behavior
https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/m/1347515/#msg_1347515

I found two ways to make this works
First, if I 
[code]
readAllQuery.setCascadePolicy(ObjectLevelReadQuery.CascadeAllParts);
[/code]
The fetch group is applied to related attributes recursively. I found that the cache setting in ReadAllQuery did not apply to related ObjectReadyQuery when it is time to retrieve related entity. Related entities are still read from cache.  If cascade is set as above, the cache is ignored. 

Another approach: I set all related attributes as join attributes. The fetchGroup is applied recursively as expected.

Can someone give me insight how it behaves like this?

thanks

//fetch group does not work for embedded relation

My Code is like this
[code]
FetchGroup fetchGroup=new FetchGroup();
fetchGroup.addAttrbiute("singleembed.streetAddress");
fetchGroup.addAttribute( "multiembed.streetAddress");
readAllQuery.setFetchGroup(fetchGroup);
[/code]

I found attribute of embedded instance is pre-loaded or load-lazily. 

I am using eclipselink 2.5.1

Anything I did wrong?

thanks

When export a module,
	The ID for inverse relationship is not changed. But these IDs are never used for import for database record insertion so
	it is not a problem.

//---------------------------------cache management:
Some objects are using AppCache Which is a local cache  cahcing object by reference. Later we may need to implement clusterd cache for cluster environment.
1. cluster cache.
2. can receieve cache event and update local structure such as Configs
3. serialize FlexdmsDynamicEntity
